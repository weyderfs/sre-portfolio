Hello, I'm Weyder. I come from a humble background, and I started working with IT in 2007, while still in my teens, after an uncle gifted me a Computer Assembly, Maintenance & Networks course at a Microlins unit in my city. Until then, I didn't imagine I would become an IT infrastructure professional; I dreamt of being an automotive mechanic. But while taking the courses, I fell in love with it, as I started understanding how a computer worked from _hardware_ to _software_ and then communication networks.

## Academic Career

In 2011, already an adult, I left my hometown and went to college in a bigger city. I started with Computer Engineering, but after a year of much struggle and reflection, I concluded it wasn't for me. I also didn't want to study Computer Science; my passion was Infra and Hardware. Since I was already working as an Infrastructure Analyst, I opted for a quicker and more focused degree in IT Management, and it was indeed the best choice I made for my career.

## Career Transition

Around 2012, I started getting interested in Linux operating systems, initially only for server use. But from 2015 onwards, I adopted it as my main operating system for daily use and work. It was also at this time, after taking a preparatory course for the Linux LPIC-1 certification, that I shifted my career focus from Microsoft environments to Linux environments and Computer Networks.

In 2015, I completed my degree in IT Management and continued studying in certification preparation courses like LPIC-2 and the old Cisco CCENT, always seeking my professional development.

## First Certification

In 2016, I obtained my first Linux certification, [LPIC-1](https://www.lpi.org/pt-br/our-certifications/lpic-1-overview), which consists of two exams: 101-500, which I aced, and 102-500, where I scored over 85%. I am still grateful to my teacher Fernando for the excellent classes he gave at Senac.

Afterward, I started preparing for the [LPIC-2](https://www.lpi.org/pt-br/our-certifications/lpic-2-overview) certification and was also finishing my Cisco CCENT course.

## A New Career Shift

Around 2015, the DevOps culture movement started gaining strength in Brazil, heavily driven by the Cloud computing "boom" in the country. At that time, I already saw migrating to this segment as the future of my career. Since I had already gained good experience in Linux environments, starting to study Docker containers, Infrastructure as Code with Terraform at the time, and AWS as a cloud provider wasn't too complex.

In 2016, given the crisis that occurred in the Brazilian political scenario, it became necessary for me to start entrepreneurship. I opened my first company and began providing consulting services, managing company environments, participating in environment and network migration projects, selling equipment, etc.

In 2018, I moved to another city again and also changed my professional focus, definitively shifting from working in mixed environments to working as a Linux Specialist, focusing on Linux Servers, Network Security, and Cloud. I was always studying modern technologies and tools used in the DevOps culture. This year, I also got my first DevOps Essentials certification.

In 2019, after much study, I got my first job as a Cloud Infrastructure Analyst with a focus on DevOps Culture. Many challenges arose, as I now genuinely started dealing with entirely Cloud AWS environments and tools like Kubernetes, Terraform, among others, which built the professional experience that brought me to where I am professionally today.

In the same year, I obtained my second DevOps Professional certification and also completed a Kubernetes preparatory course for the CKA.

# Projects

## Terraform/OpenTofu Modules Developer

With the skills I acquired working with IaC, I felt a strong need for standardization and module creation for daily work. And since I believe in the power of Open Source Software, I also make my modules available to the community:
